# Python Projects

- This is a repository to store all of the projects which I work on in **Python** Language.

- This Folder Contains 2 Sub-Folders:

  - `Major Projects:`
      Which Will Contain All the Major Projects in that Language. These have quite a Significance. They are well thought and are trying to solve some real world issue.

  - `Minor Projects:`
      Which will contain some minor projects made just for practice in that language. These are projects which are made in order to just practice a particular topic in that Language.
